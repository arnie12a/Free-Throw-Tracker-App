# 🏀 Free Throw Percentage Tracker

Track and analyze your free throw shooting performance—and see how you stack up against the pros.

## 🌟 Inspiration

This project began from a personal habit I started in high school: tracking my own free throw percentages during practice. Everyday after basketball practice, our coach would make us run laps and then shoot 10 free throws which we would then track in an excel file with out basketball manager. This inspired me to create my first Java program where I would track my own shooting outside of practice and see if I make improvements in my shooting percentage as I practice more and more on my hoop in my driveway. As I have learned more and more tech stacks, I have continnuously made improvements to the app until the current version I have built.
